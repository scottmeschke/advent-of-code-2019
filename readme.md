# 2019 Advent of Code solutions  
   
Each day is a separate module, and the top level project compiles to an application which runs each day.  
   
The general structure inside each day module is the following:  
   
* **Lib.kt** - General logic for the day  
* **App.kt** - Top level "app" to run the solutions for the day  
* **Tests.kt** - Tests for the logic for the day
 
## The premise
 
Santa has become stranded at the edge of the Solar System while delivering presents to other planets!

To accurately calculate his position in space, safely align his warp drive, and return to Earth in time to save Christmas, he needs you to bring him  measurements  from  _fifty stars_.
 
Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants  _one star_. Good luck!
